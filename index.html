            <h3 id="bio-title">Who I am</h3>
            <p class="bio-content" id="bio-1">
            I am a full stack web developer who recently graduated from Thinkful's full stack flex program. 
            I have been coding for about a year and a half, constantly striving to hone my skills and think of 
            unique and relevant ways to apply them. I have a history in social welfare, so the specific intersection 
            between the possibilities of technology and the very pressing needs for accessibility to services that 
            improve our society's health and wellness is very interesting to me. You can see this desire reflected in 
            my applications.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-content" id="bio-2">
            I have experience coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including libraries such as jQuery and 
            React/Context), and working with AJAX calls on the front end. On the back end, I have experience with the 
            server construction using the Express framework and NPM package manager for Node, database construction using 
            MongoDB/Mongoose, and testing with Mocha and Jest where and when they are needed.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-content" id="bio-3">
            While I am rather new to everything, I am quick to learn, and have no problem taking criticism in order to improve my skills. 
            Personally, I enjoy gaming, reading, and viewing just about anything and everything fantasy and science fiction. 
            Storytelling is important for us as people, and it can be equally relevant when building an application. 
            I also love spending time with friends and family, traveling, and trying new things!
