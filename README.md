# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website that shows what languages and frameworks I work best with, as well as how to get in contact with me.

Currently the site is in a graybox wireframe live state. You can access the live site here: https://jtrcoonz.github.io/Portfolio/

The landing page will load by default. simply add "contact" to the end of the url in order to view the greybox wire frame for the contact page.
