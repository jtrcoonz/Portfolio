# Jacob Coons | Portfolio


## What It Is
This application is my professional portfolio, constructed as a static website consisting of HTML, CSS, and some minimalist front-end JS/jQuery. It has 2 main pages, the home and contact pages, as well as some external links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. It is hosted by GitHub pages and was bult using mobile-first design practices.


## How to Use It

### The Home Page
The home page is made up 4 core features:

#### The Nav Bar...
is fixed on the top of the viewport, and scrolls with the user in order to make navigation quick and efficient. It consists of 5 links.

1. Jacob Coons - This site title also also allows users to navigate home using an onClick event listener
2. Home - A standard link that navigates the user home
3. Contact - A standard link that navigates the user to the Contact page
4. GitHub - A standard link that navigates the user to my GitHub page
5. LinkedIn - A standard link that navigates the user to my LinkedIn page

#### The Tagline/Bio...
consists of a dad joke (very on brand, I assure you), and a brief description of my goals in technology, my skill set, and a little bit about myself.

#### The Portfolio...
contains my four main projects I have built. Each project section contains a small introductory line, a screenshot of the project's homepage, the title of the project, technologies used, links to the live site and repository, and a description of the project.

#### The Footer...
serves as additional navigation options to contact me, and visist my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.

### The Contact Page
The contact page contains my contact information, formatted to create a new email or begin a call when clicking the information. It also contains the same nav bar and footer as the home page.
